Toyota's Harry was built with one purpose in mind: to play the trumpet. And boy, can he toot that horn. Though it could easily cheat with some well hidden speakers, the robot authentically plays the trumpet, pushing the compressed air through flexible lips, and hitting the valves for each note with a methodical accuracy.<br><br>
