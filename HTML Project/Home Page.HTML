<P>A <B>robot</B> is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.</P>
<P>Robotics, Design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve <B>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</B>; robots may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature. Some are even capable of simple decision making, and current robotics research is geared toward devising robots with a degree of self-sufficiency that will permit mobility and decision-making in an unstructured environment. Today’s industrial robots do not resemble human beings; a robot in human form is called an <B>Android</B>.</P>
<P>Whether they're taking our jobs, acting as our personal butlers or planning mankind's robopocalypse downfall, we've been obsessed with robots for centuries. What's surprising is Hanson Robotics' <B>Sophia - a robot - was even granted citizenship</B> in Saudi Arabia recetly. While Sophia is the first to get this distinction, here are few more of her kind that are set to change the way we live, work and love:</P>
