<p>Perhaps the most recognisable real world robot in existense, ASIMO has been wondering crowds around the world since it was first shown off. Moving with presisely applied agility, ASIMO is as close as we have come to the sci-fi vision of a robot companion - even if his social interactions aren't quite as redefined as his dexterous wave and silky strut. ASIMO (whose name comes from English initials or words Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) is a humanoid robot created by Honda in 2000. It is currently displayed in Miraikan museum in the Japanese capital city of Tokyo.</p>
